# Cybersecurity Fundamentals - Labs & Projects

		<h1> Performing Reconnaissance and Probing Using Common Tools </h1>
			<h2> Overview </h2>
				<p>I engaged with various essential applications and tools vital for cybersecurity exploration.
				These included RSA Network Investigator, Wireshark, Nessus, FileZilla, Zenmap, and PuTTY. Through hands-on exercises,
				I delved into fundamental concepts such as promiscuous mode in Wireshark, which facilitates comprehensive packet
				analysis across subnets or VLANs. I also explored the distinctions between Wireshark and NetWitness Investigator, 
				discovering their unique approaches to network investigationâ€”Wireshark provides a granular view of individual 
				packets, while NetWitness Investigator categorizes and organizes traffic for pattern analysis. Moreover, 
				I learned the importance of selecting the appropriate interface in Wireshark to filter data accurately, 
				enabling focused analysis within the student lab environment. 
				Command-line proficiency was honed as I executed an Intense Scan with Zenmap,
				employing syntax precision to probe a target subnet effectively. Throughout the lab, 
				I engaged with various scan options offered by Zenmap, such as Ping Scan, Intense Scan, and Quick Scan, 
				each serving distinct purposes in network reconnaissance. The culmination of the lab involved interpreting the 
				results obtained from the Intense Scan, which revealed 110 distinct tests conducted to gather comprehensive 
				information about the target network. Zenmap's discovery of six IP hosts, including the local host, provided 
				valuable insights into the network's composition and potential vulnerabilities. 
				This hands-on experience in reconnaissance and probing with common cybersecurity tools laid a strong foundation for
				understanding network security fundamentals and their practical applications.

			<h2> Tools Used </h2>
				<p>
				In this lab, various applications and tools were employed to conduct reconnaissance and probing tasks in cybersecurity. 
				These tools included: 
				</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>RSA Network Investigator:</strong> RSA Network Investigator is a network forensics tool used for analyzing network traffic and detecting security incidents.
				It leverages technologies such as packet capture and analysis, deep packet inspection, and behavior analytics to identify threats and investigate security breaches. </li>
				<li><strong>Wireshark:</strong> Wireshark is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer that allows users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. 
				It supports various protocols and technologies, including TCP/IP, Ethernet, HTTP, and SSL/TLS, providing detailed insights into network communication. </li>
				<li><strong>Nessus:</strong> Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that helps identify potential security vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications. It utilizes a database of known vulnerabilities and performs various checks to assess the security posture of target assets. 
				Technologies used include vulnerability scanning, CVE database, and compliance auditing. </li>
				<li><strong>FileZilla:</strong> FileZilla is a cross-platform FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client used for transferring files between a client and a server over a network. 
				It supports FTP, FTPS, and SFTP protocols and provides a user-friendly interface for managing file transfers securely. </li>
				<li><strong>Zenmap:</strong>Zenmap is the graphical frontend for Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool used for network discovery and security auditing.
				Zenmap provides an intuitive interface for configuring and executing Nmap scans, allowing users to visualize network topology, detect open ports, and identify potential vulnerabilities.  </li>
				<li><strong>PuTTY:</strong>  PuTTY is a free and open-source SSH (Secure Shell) and telnet client used for remote access to computers over a network. It supports various protocols, including SSH, Telnet, and SCP, and offers features like session management, SSH key authentication, and tunneling capabilities. </li>
				</ul>
