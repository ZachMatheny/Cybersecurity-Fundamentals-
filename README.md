		<h1> Performing Reconnaissance and Probing Using Common Tools </h1>
			<h2> Overview </h2>
				<p>I engaged with various essential applications and tools vital for cybersecurity exploration.
				These included RSA Network Investigator, Wireshark, Nessus, FileZilla, Zenmap, and PuTTY. Through hands-on exercises,
				I delved into fundamental concepts such as promiscuous mode in Wireshark, which facilitates comprehensive packet
				analysis across subnets or VLANs. I also explored the distinctions between Wireshark and NetWitness Investigator, 
				discovering their unique approaches to network investigationâ€”Wireshark provides a granular view of individual 
				packets, while NetWitness Investigator categorizes and organizes traffic for pattern analysis. Moreover, 
				I learned the importance of selecting the appropriate interface in Wireshark to filter data accurately, 
				enabling focused analysis within the student lab environment. 
				Command-line proficiency was honed as I executed an Intense Scan with Zenmap,
				employing syntax precision to probe a target subnet effectively. Throughout the lab, 
				I engaged with various scan options offered by Zenmap, such as Ping Scan, Intense Scan, and Quick Scan, 
				each serving distinct purposes in network reconnaissance. The culmination of the lab involved interpreting the 
				results obtained from the Intense Scan, which revealed 110 distinct tests conducted to gather comprehensive 
				information about the target network. Zenmap's discovery of six IP hosts, including the local host, provided 
				valuable insights into the network's composition and potential vulnerabilities. 
				This hands-on experience in reconnaissance and probing with common cybersecurity tools laid a strong foundation for
				understanding network security fundamentals and their practical applications.

		<h1> Enabling Windows Active Directory and User Access Controls</h1>
			<h2> Overview</h2>
				<p>
				In my exploration of this project, I delved into fundamental principles of information system security. 
				Throughout the session, I grasped the significance of three critical elements crucial for an effective security
				program: Identification, Authorization, and Authentication. As I delved into practical
				applications, I learned how Authentication and access control serve as pivotal controls wielded
				by the Domain User Admin to orchestrate user accounts and resource permissions. Moreover, 
				I gained insights into the nuanced realm of access controls and permissions on Windows network 
				shares, understanding the efficacy of Security Policy-based controls like "List Folder Contents." 
				The Group Policy Editor emerged as a centralized command center for managing granular policies and permissions across the network.
				Expanding my knowledge further, I explored the concept of two-factor authentication, recognizing its role in fortifying security by requiring dual authentication methods for user access. 
				To uphold Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) for departmental LANs and data, I employed Windows Server Active Directory to configure access controls within the Active Directory domain partition.
				Additionally, I acknowledged the importance of safeguarding against password vulnerabilities, such as abstaining from incorporating account or username information. Through practical insights and hands-on experience, 
				this session underscored the imperative of implementing robust security measures to safeguard information systems and resources in contemporary digital landscapes.
				</p>
			<h2> Tools Used </h2>
				<p>
				In exploring "Enabling Windows Active Directory and User Access Controls," I engaged with a suite of tools and technologies essential for implementing robust security measures in Windows environments.
				These tools empower users to configure user access controls, manage permissions, and uphold the integrity of information systems. Let's delve into the tools and technologies leveraged in this endeavor:
				</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Windows Active Directory:</strong> Windows Active Directory serves as the backbone for user authentication and access management in Windows environments.
				It provides a centralized database for storing user accounts, group memberships, and security policies, enabling administrators to manage network resources efficiently.  </li>
				<li><strong>Group Policy Editor:</strong> The Group Policy Editor is a powerful tool for managing granular policies and permissions across Windows networks. It allows administrators to define and enforce security settings,
				software installation policies, and other configurations for users and computers within an Active Directory environment.  </li>
				<li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Two-Factor Authentication enhances security by requiring users to provide two different forms of identification before granting access.
				This typically involves something the user knows (like a password) and something they possess (like a smartphone or token), adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.  </li>
				</ul>

		<h1>Performing a Web Site and Database Attack by Exploiting Identified Vulnerabilities</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
				In this lab, I delved into conducting penetration tests on web applications and servers before their production implementation.
				This preemptive measure is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating potential risks inherent in deployment. Exploring the intricacies of cyber threats, 
				I learned about cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers manipulate web forms to inject and execute malicious scripts, jeopardizing user data security. Additionally, I delved into reflective cross-site scripting attacks, 
				leveraging trusted user servers to execute nefarious scripts within trusted sites, presenting significant security risks. Furthermore, the lab illuminated the threat posed by SQL injection attacks, which can extract sensitive data from databases. 
				I explored security countermeasures to fortify defenses against such threats, including configuration maintenance, access restriction enforcement, and robust user authentication policies. Recognizing the critical importance of integrating penetration testing and web application testing into organizational procedures, 
				I reinforced my understanding of cybersecurity responsibilities, particularly regarding the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of production web applications and servers. Through practical exercises, I encountered various user names revealed during the inquiry, including "admin," "Gordon Brown," and "Pablo Picasso,"
				underscoring the need for vigilant identification and remediation of vulnerabilities to bolster web application and database security.
